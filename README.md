## Jubjub

This an implementation of the [Jubjub](https://z.cash/ja/technology/jubjub/) curve from Zcash Sapling. It is correct and has a complete API driven primarily by the need to do Sapling note decryption. The structure of the code is inspired by several related implementations I've worked on, including [ristretto255's internals](https://github.com/gtank/ristretto255) and the [edwards25519](https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/edwards25519) package now maintained by [Filippo Valsorda](https://github.com/filosottile). A refinement expressed here more strongly than in those libraries is that points, scalars, and field elements are not meant to be constructed but should be parsed from existing bytes (and thus subject to checks) or produced by operations within the curve context. This should help developers avoid common situations where a type contains an unexpectedly incorrect value. However, those types do know how to subsequently encode themselves without further reference to the curve, since they already know what they are.

While the library strives to be clear, due to its origins in a personal project it's neither fast nor especially robust against misuse. Feel free to get in touch if you would like it to become those things.
